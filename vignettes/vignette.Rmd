## The Data Set

In order to show the multiple options of Trex, the example data is derived from [GSE167118](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE167118) - a cohort of CITE-seq data derived from severe COVID-19 patients. The [corresponding manuscript](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622974/) is excellent. The data example built into the package (trex_example) is derived from randomly sampling the single-cells from patient 17. However, for the purposes of this vignette, we will use the whole data set, showing the initial processing steps that led to the seurat object you can load directly. 

This is a standard workflow based on the [WNN](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/weighted_nearest_neighbor_analysis.html) Seurat process. However Trex will work for Bioconductor/Single-Cell Experiment workflows as well. The major exception is the addition of ```quietTCRgenes()```, which removed T cell receptor genes from the variable gene list used for ```runPCA()```. In addition the final 2 rows of the ADT assay are removed, as they are antibodies for specific TCRV products. This prevents the weighting the embedding based on both genes and clonotype information. Removing T cell receptor genes is also a common practice before dimensional reduction.

# Running Trex

The idea behind Trex is to combine TCR cdr3 amino acid information with phenotypic RNA/protein data to direct the use of single-cell sequencing towards antigen-specific discoveries. In doing so, Trex combines multiple layers of TCR information, as selected by the user. These layers are then used for form a multiplexed network using the individual cell barcodes as nodes. The network analysis is simplified and eigen vectors on the adjacency matrix to produce unique TCR dimensional reduction. This is a growing field - specifically [TESSA](https://github.com/jcao89757/TESSA) uses amino acid characteristics and autoencoder to as a means to get a dimensional reduction. Another option is [CoNGA](https://github.com/phbradley/conga), which produces a embedding using TCR and RNA. Trex was designed to make a customizable approach to this combined approach using R.

## maTrex Function

Trex has 2 major functions - the first being ```maTrex()```, which is the backbone of the algorithm and returns the latent vectors based on the selection of variables. Unlike ```runTrx()``` below, ```maTrex()``` does not filter the input for only T cells with attached TCR data. 

**chains**  
* "TRA" for TCR A  
* "TRB" for TCR B  
* "both" for both chains  

**AA.properties**  
* "AF" to use Atchley factors  
* "KF" to use Kidera factors  
* "both" to use both  
* NULL to not include the amino acid properties in final network

**AA.method** 
* "mean" to take the mean for each cdr3 sequence based on the selected AA.property  
* "auto" to embed the AA.properties using an Autoencoder  

**nearest.method**
* "threshold" to call neighbors by a normalize distance value
* "nn" to call nearest neighbors


```{r}
Trex_vectors <- maTrex(trex_example, 
                      edit.method = "lv",
                      AA.method = "mean", 
                      AA.properties = "KF", 
                      nearest.method = "nn",
                      add.INKT = FALSE,
                      add.MAIT = FALSE,
                      near.neighbor = 40)

qplot(data = as.data.frame(Trex_vectors), Trex_2, Trex_3) + theme_classic()
```

## runTrex

Additionally, ```runTrex()``` can be used append the Seurat or Single-cell Experiment object with the Trex vectors and allow for further analysis. Importantly, ```runTrex()``` will remove single-cells that do not have recovered TCR data in the meta data of the object. 
                    
```{r}
trex_example <- runTrex(trex_example, 
                    edit.method = "lv",
                    AA.method = "auto", 
                    AA.properties = "KF", 
                    nearest.method = "nn",
                    near.neighbor = 30,
                    reduction.name = "Trex.KF")
```


## Using Trex Vectors

After ```runTrex()``` we have the eigen vectors for the TCR layers that we have selected stored under **"Trex..."**. Using the Trex reduction stored in Seurat, we can calculate the nearest neighbor ause_condaenv(condaenv = "r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
nd shared nearest neighbor indexes and generate a UMAP. In general, the nearest-neighbor-based UMAP will have more distributed points for easier visualization compared to directly using ```RunUMAP()``` on the Trex reduction.

```{r}
neighbors <- FindNeighbors(trex_example@reductions$Trex.KF, 
                                       annoy.metric = "cosine",
                                       k.param = 30, 
                                       verbose = FALSE)

#Adding the Neighbors to the Seurat Object
names(neighbors) <- paste0("Trex.KF_", names(neighbors))
graph.names <- names(neighbors)
for(i in seq_len(length(graph.names))) {
          suppressWarnings(trex_example[[graph.names[i]]] <- neighbors[[i]])
  }

#Generating UMAP from Trex Neighbors
trex_example <- RunUMAP(trex_example, graph = "Trex.KF_snn", 
                        reduction.name = 'Trex.umap', reduction.key = 'trexUMAP_')
#Trex UMAP
plot1 <- DimPlot(trex_example) + NoLegend()
plot2 <- DimPlot(trex_example, group.by = "CTaa") + scale_color_manual(values =viridis::viridis_pal(option = "B")(length(unique(trex_example$CTaa)))) + NoLegend()

plot1 + plot2
```


We now can use this in a similar way as other single-cell modalities and calculate weighted nearest neighbor (WNN). To check out more on WNN, please read the Satija's group [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34062119/). We will use the RNA, ADT protein levels, and Trex vectors for the WNN calculations. 

```{r}
trex_example <- FindMultiModalNeighbors(
  trex_example, reduction.list = list("pca", "apca", "Trex.KF"), 
  dims.list = list(1:30, 1:20, 1:30), modality.weight.name = "RNA.weight"
)
trex_example <- RunUMAP(trex_example, nn.name = "weighted.nn", 
                     reduction.name = "wnn.umap", reduction.key = "wnnUMAP_")
trex_example <- FindClusters(trex_example, graph.name = "wsnn", resolution = 0.6,
                          algorithm = 3, verbose = FALSE)

#WNN UMAP
plot3 <- DimPlot(trex_example, reduction = "wnn.umap")
plot4 <- DimPlot(trex_example, reduction = "wnn.umap", group.by = "CTaa") + scale_color_manual(values = viridis_pal(option = "B")(length(unique(trex_example$CTaa)))) + NoLegend()

plot3 + plot4
```

## Comparing the outcome to just one modality

We can also look at the differences in the UMAP generated from RNA, ADT, or Trex as individual components. Remember the clusters that we are displaying in UMAP is based on clusters defined by the weighted nearest neighbors calculated above. 

```{r}
trex_example <- RunUMAP(trex_example, reduction = 'pca', dims = 1:30, assay = 'RNA', 
              reduction.name = 'rna.umap', reduction.key = 'rnaUMAP_')
trex_example <- RunUMAP(trex_example, reduction = 'apca', dims = 1:20, assay = 'ADT', 
              reduction.name = 'adt.umap', reduction.key = 'adtUMAP_')


plot5 <- DimPlot(trex_example, reduction = "rna.umap") + NoLegend()
plot6 <- DimPlot(trex_example, reduction = "adt.umap") + NoLegend()
plot7 <- DimPlot(trex_example, reduction = "Trex.umap") + NoLegend()

plot5 + plot6 + plot7
```
