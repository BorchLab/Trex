Description: Implementation of the Trex algorithm for single-cell embedding based on TCR sequences. The package includes a standalone function to encode TCR sequence information by amino acid properties or sequence order using tensorflow-based autoencoder. In addition, the package interacts with SingleCellExperiment or Seurat data objects.
