DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

* Deprecate clonalCommunity() 


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.10
------------------------
- fixed issuer with TRB OHE encoder returning NaN or zero values
- "both" call now pulls all AF/KF without error

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
------------------------
- maTrex() now offers support for scRepertoire combineTCR() output and not just single-cell objects alone.
- CoNGAfy() function modified for additional meta variable support - will automatically check the duplicated clones for multiple values and condense with ";"
- New format of encoder models to reduce size of package


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.8
------------------------
- update to the database used in annotateDB(), cleaned data extensively
- Correct CoNGAfy() function to fix mean-based reduction
- Added edit distance parameter to annotateDB()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.7
------------------------
- Added one hot auto encoder to model options


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.7
------------------------

* Dev/Maine pull - will update move towards new model architecture from here.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.6
------------------------

* After comparing the outputs of various calculations Trex offers - by far the best performing is returning the auto encoded values. Removed distance calculations and gene usage statistics. 
* Expanding auto encoder models to use 288,090 unique TCRs and 455,779 unique TCRBs derived from both single-cell cohorts and bulk databases - VDJdb, McPAS, IEdb, and TRAdb.
* Plan to add one-hot auto-encoder for sequence information and a database of TCRs


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5
------------------------

* CoNGAfy now can reduce the size of multiple dimensions using mean or distance. 
* Moving the auto encoder distance back to cosine distance - per row the calculation will be 1-abs(cos())
* Modified runTrex() to allow for generating layers without the edit distance (before it just errored out). 

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.4
------------------------

* Added CoNGAfy() function to reduce RNA to a single cell per clonotype based on either mean expression or euclidean distance of the PCA.
* Changed normalization for length-based distance calculation, was effectively halving the true distance, over calling neighbors when using thresholding. 
* AA property normalization now uses Euclidean distance instead of cosine. Simplifies the normalization. 
* Removed the multicore parallelization, after implementing the above (and removing the over calling issue) the code is substantially faster when using thresholding!


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
------------------------

* Added clonalCommunity() function to allow for assignment and subsequent regression of feature space of groupings.
* Changed neighbor.manager. Reverted the nearest neighbor proximation to the original version which only randomizes clones. Threshold detection changed to use expand.grid() instead of looping through all barcodes. 
* Added support for aaReduction() and distReduction to the clonalCommunity() function
* Added multicore parallelization to aaProperty() and distanceMatrix() function to speed up reduction. On an object of 3200 cells, sped the calculation up 8x.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
------------------------

* Added seed parameter to improve reproducibility 
* Added clone.proportion parameter to select for the relative number of duplicates to allow into nearest neighbor evaluation
* New internal function neighbor.manager - nearest neighbor approximation is now based on clone proportion (for clones), the remaining neighbors are randomized across unique clones in the vicinity of the clonotype/cell in question. 
* Modified Mean approach for aa.property now references the correct columns in generating output frame and the cosine distance function
* Changed internal function parameters to prevent the recursive issue.
* added aaReduction() and distReduction() functions to get intermediate values for a layer. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
------------------------

* Changed metric functions as it related to memory. Firstly, no more as.matrix() calls, this prevents upper ceiling on memory usage. 
* Now distance is computed and from each row, a normalized comparison is made using the method for near call, which is then converted and stored as an edge list. This eliminates 3 matrices - pairwise distance matrix, normalized distance matrix and the adjacency matrix. Based on some benchmarking, this is a reduction in memory of around 3 (matrices) x 50. 
*Edge list is now used to form multiplex graph object, with the list of edges across layers used to make supraAdjacency matrix.
* AAProperties distance calculated using cosine using the philanthropy package - this returns a distance object instead of a Pearson correlation-based pairwise matrix, saves time and memory
* Gene Usage Metrics return edge list directly, no intermediate adjacency matrix
